# Footwear-Size-Detection-using-OpenCV
1. FOOTWEAR SIZE DETECTION OF FOOT IMAGE USING OPENCV
	In this project we are calculating the foot size and get the footwear sizes of three different standards(US,UK and European).

2. CODES STYLE
	OpenCV Python.

3. INSTALLATION
	Dumping Rasbian OS into a memory card and inserting into a raspberry pi board.
	Install the necessary OpenCV library files.
	Creat database of the foot sizes which are extracted and standard size.
	Run the code and insert the values of the standard size and extracted size.

4.PROJECT USAGE
	Sample foot are used.
	Run the source code which will display the actual foot length in coordinates of the graph. 
	Displays the foot sizes of all three standards (UK,US,European).
